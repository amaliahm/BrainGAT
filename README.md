# 🧠 BrainGAT

Graph Attention Network Approach for Multi-Class Brain Tumor Segmentation, a research project exploring the use of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for multi-class brain tumor segmentation using MRI images. It is based on the paper *“Multi-class Brain Tumor Segmentation using Graph Attention Network”* and leverages the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle.

### 🧩 Overview

> Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis. Traditional CNNs fail to capture long-range spatial dependencies. This project investigates how Graph Attention Networks (GATs) can represent pixel/region relationships as a graph to enhance segmentation performance.

#### 📊 Dataset 

**Dataset:** [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).

It's a combination of those three datasets: figshare, SARTAJ dataset and Br35H.

Contains MRI scans categorized into 4 classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and healthy brain.

Preprocessing steps: resizing, normalization, graph construction from pixel regions or superpixels.
